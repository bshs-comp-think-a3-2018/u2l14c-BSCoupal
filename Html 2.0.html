    <p> Html 2.0 was created as an expansion of HTML 1.0 and was made to be a web standard. Unlike the original HTML, HTML 2.0 was created by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), though Tim Berners-Lee still played an active role in it's creation. HTML 2.0 was standardized as a RFC (request for comment) project in 1995. HTML went under four updates in November 1995, May 1996, August 1996, and January 1997 but had many updates prior to the release of the memo in November 1995.</p>
