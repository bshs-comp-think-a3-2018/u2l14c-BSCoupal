    <p>HTML was originally developed as a tool for Tim Berners-Lee to build the World Wide Web at CERN. Berners-Lee began developing HTML in 1989 but released it in 1993, but not officialy published as  standard. The idea of hypertext existed before the creation of html. The first version of HTML was based off of Standardized General Markup Language (SGML), which was released in 1986. </p>
